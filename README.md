# Python
Python programming learning
    mostly binary file manipulation

    XOR                             "Working"
    Create Binary File              "Working"
    file_in                         "Working"
    Invert_bits                     "Working"
    bit_delta                       "Not Working"


Waveform
    built with ai
    Installed modules
        pip install scipy
        pip install numpy
        pip install matplotlib
        pip install mayavi --no-cache-dir --verbose  --no-build-isolation


read bits should be in file_in
setup user input with asking what function and what data
